# Lava-api

## WordPress automation helper

The repository now contains a small helper that can log into a WordPress site
and retrieve pages from the admin interface.  It is especially handy when you
need to automate tasks such as downloading information from WooCommerce's
"Import Export Suite â†’ Subscriptions" screen.

```python
from app.wordpress_client import fetch_subscriptions_page

html = fetch_subscriptions_page(
    base_url="https://lavamedia.be",
    username="votre.identifiant",
    password="votre.mot.de.passe",
)

print(html[:500])
```

The module also exposes the :class:`app.wordpress_client.WordPressClient`
class, which gives you more control if you want to navigate to other admin
pages.

## Automating the WooCommerce export with Playwright

When hosts block scripted HTTP clients the repository also ships with a
Playwright-based automation helper that drives a headless Chromium instance to
perform the login flow exactly like a user would.

```python
from app.playwright_exporter import export_subscriptions_csv_with_playwright

content, filename, content_type = export_subscriptions_csv_with_playwright(
    base_url="https://lavamedia.be",
    username="votre.identifiant",
    password="votre.mot.de.passe",
)

print(filename, len(content), content_type)
```

Make sure to install the browser binaries once in your environment with
`playwright install chromium` before running the helper.
