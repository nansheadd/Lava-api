## WordPress automation helper

The repository now contains a small helper that can log into a WordPress site
and retrieve pages from the admin interface.  It is especially handy when you
need to automate tasks such as downloading information from WooCommerce's
"Import Export Suite â†’ Subscriptions" screen.

```python
from app.wordpress_client import fetch_subscriptions_page

html = fetch_subscriptions_page(
    base_url="https://lavamedia.be",
    username="votre.identifiant",
    password="votre.mot.de.passe",
)

print(html[:500])
```

The module also exposes the :class:`app.wordpress_client.WordPressClient`
class, which gives you more control if you want to navigate to other admin
pages.
